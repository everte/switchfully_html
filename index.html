        <h2>Love for cycling and hpv:</h2>
            <p>
            My main bike is a velomobile (a faired recumbent bike). I enjoy the efficiency: fantastic to cruise at high speeds powered solely by human power. The rowing bike is a fantastic workout and when feeling funky there always is the unicycle!
            </p>

        <h3>Geeky stuff:</h3>
            <p>
            Using <em>linux</em> since 2008 as main operating system. I love <strong>open source</strong> and the power of a terminal.
            <br/>
            Using dvorak keyboard layout on a mechanical keyboard with loud blue switches. Firefox with ublock origin to browse the interenet. I enjoy tinkering with electronics and micro-controllers like the esp8266 in my free time.
